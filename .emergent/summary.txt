The trajectory details the development of Erebus Protocol, a Solana privacy application, transitioning from an initial MVP to a feature-rich and aesthetically polished product. The work was highly iterative and driven by specific user feedback in Indonesian.

A significant portion of the effort was dedicated to UI/UX enhancements. The AI engineer first restyled the wallet adapter modal, then completely redesigned the landing page multiple times. This included cloning a reference website, integrating a video background, adding Lottie file animations for feature cards, and applying advanced CSS effects like a shimmering text animation.

Several technical challenges were addressed. A persistent  build error was resolved by configuring the Python path for yarn. A major architectural pivot occurred when integrating the Jupiter Swap API; backend DNS resolution failures inside the container environment forced the logic to be moved to the client-side. Subsequently, SPL token balance and metadata detection were also migrated to the client-side to improve reliability, using the Jupiter Token List API with a caching mechanism.

Feature-wise, the Wormhole bridge was requested and then removed. A comprehensive, static documentation page () was built from scratch. The most recent task involved enhancing token metadata retrieval, where the AI first implemented a solution using Jupiter's API, and was then directed to investigate and potentially switch to the  API.

<product_requirements>
The objective is to build Erebus Protocol, a Zero-Knowledge (ZK) privacy web application on the Solana network with a gold and dark theme.

**Core User-Facing Features:**
1.  **Polished Landing Page:** A modern, visually engaging landing page that was iteratively built and eventually cloned from a reference site. It features a video background, Lottie animations, and advanced CSS effects.
2.  **Solana Wallet Integration:** Users must be able to connect their Solana wallets. A Dashboard button should appear in the navigation bar upon successful connection.
3.  **Dashboard Functionality:**
    *   **Token Swap:** A swap interface that should use the Jupiter Aggregator for real-time quotes and transaction execution.
    *   **Token Transfer:** A component to transfer SOL and any SPL token from the user's wallet.
4.  **Developer Documentation:** A comprehensive, single-page  section detailing the protocol's concepts and API endpoints.

**Implementation Summary:**
An MVP has been transformed through extensive UI/UX work. The initial backend-heavy approach for swap quotes and balance checks proved unreliable due to container DNS issues. This led to a significant architectural shift, moving Jupiter API calls and SPL token/balance discovery to the client-side (browser), making the application more robust. The core ZK privacy logic remains conceptual.

<key_technical_concepts>
- **Frameworks:** React (Frontend), FastAPI (Backend).
- **Styling:** TailwindCSS, supplemented with global CSS for animations and overrides.
- **Solana Integration:** , , , .
- **API Integration:** Jupiter Aggregator API (for swaps and token list), Lottie for web animations.
- **Architectural Pattern:** Shifted from backend-centric logic to a **client-side first** approach for critical blockchain interactions (swap quotes, balance checks) to circumvent backend container network limitations (DNS resolution errors).
- **Build Tooling:**  for webpack config overrides (polyfills for Solana).
</key_technical_concepts>
<code_architecture>
The application follows a standard monorepo structure with a React frontend and a FastAPI backend.



- ****
    - **Importance:** This is the main marketing and entry page. It is the most frequently and heavily modified file.
    - **Summary of Changes:** The file was completely overwritten to clone a new design from a reference URL. It now integrates a video background, multiple Lottie animations for feature cards (from the  directory), and custom CSS animations for a shimmering headline effect. Sections were added, removed, and completely redesigned based on user feedback.

- ****
    - **Importance:** Contains the core token swapping functionality.
    - **Summary of Changes:** Major refactoring was done to solve critical bugs. The logic for fetching swap quotes was moved from the backend to the client-side to bypass backend DNS issues. Logic for fetching user's token balances was also moved to the client-side using  for accuracy, as the previous backend endpoint was failing.

- ****
    - **Importance:** Allows users to transfer their SPL tokens.
    - **Summary of Changes:** Similar to , the logic to fetch the user's list of owned tokens was moved to the client-side. It was then enhanced to fetch and cache token metadata (name, symbol, logo) from the Jupiter Token List API to provide a richer user experience.

- ****
    - **Importance:** A new, standalone page for developer documentation.
    - **Summary of Changes:** Created from scratch to provide a comprehensive guide, including API reference with code snippets and a base URL as requested by the user.

- ****
    - **Importance:** The backend API server. Its role in the swap process has diminished.
    - **Summary of Changes:** Initially modified to integrate the real Jupiter API. Due to persistent DNS errors (), the code was updated to include a graceful fallback mechanism. It now primarily serves as a backup for swap quotes if the frontend API call fails.

- ****
    - **Importance:** Manages frontend dependencies.
    - **Summary of Changes:** The  package was removed. New packages  (for animations) and  (for balance checking) were added.

<pending_tasks>
- **Implement True ZK Privacy:** The core ZK-proof generation and private transaction routing (User -> Treasury -> Destination) logic is not implemented.
- **Finalize Jupiter Swap Integration:** The client-side swap implementation needs to be fully tested and verified to handle all edge cases and ensure successful transaction execution.
- **Implement Real-time Price Updates:** The application does not yet use a WebSocket (WSS) connection for live price updates as originally envisioned.

<current_work>
The previous engineer was working on enhancing the token metadata display (logo, name, symbol) across the application. The user reported that balances for SPL tokens were detected, but the associated metadata was missing.

To solve this, the engineer first implemented a solution in  that fetches the comprehensive Jupiter Token List (), caches it, and uses it to look up token details by their mint address. This successfully added the requested logos and symbols.

Immediately after this implementation was completed, the user provided a link to a different API, , and instructed the engineer to learn it. The last action taken was the engineer acknowledging this and beginning to analyze the documentation for this new API. The context suggests the user wants to replace or augment the just-implemented Jupiter token list solution with this new  service.
</current_work>
<optional_next_step>
Integrate the  API to fetch token details by contract address, replacing or augmenting the current Jupiter Token List implementation as per the user's latest request.
